3D Printed Motor Mount & Wheel Pulley
-------------------------------------


Originally I found a post on [Endless-Sphere](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=67792) where 'strygw' created a 3D printed motor mount and pulley. Which were perfect start to the project. Only after printing the pulley I realized the sizes were quite off (different wheel size). So I measured up my wheel and began to learn [Autodesk 132D](http://www.123dapp.com/) which worked pretty well for basic stuff. I then moved onto [Autodesk Fusion 360](http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360) which was a tad difficult to pick up at first but vastly more advance and useful. I modified the pulley to fit my wheel, printed and it fitted perfectly snug.
